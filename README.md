# Boise State Robotics Research
This repo contains code for robot control in the [Plasma Engineering Lab](https://www.boisestate.edu/coen-ece/research/) at Boise State. 
## Control Classes
The control classes folder contains classes to provide an easier interface for controlling the robot and scripts using those classes. Take a look at the README in that folder for more details.
## Scripts
The InterbotixScripts folder contains scripts for controlling the robot using the interface provided by rospy or the robot manufacturer. This code are examples to understand how the control worked in order to create the classes. 
## Other Code
Other Code is any other test scripts created when lengthy algorithms used to create the classes, usually for some sort of data processing. It is easier to test outside of the class before creating an all encompassing class.
